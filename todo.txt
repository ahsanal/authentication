- Improve infra scripts
  - ./infra up             # Create all
  - ./infra up ldap authn  # Create ldap and authn
  - ./infra down           # Delete all
  - ./infra down k8s       # Delete k8s 
  - Put args 2..X in array. If arg 2 is empty, then array is [network, ldap, authn, k8s]. Then switch-case for each element.
- In authn.go, take key and certificate files as command-line arguments
